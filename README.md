Draft, architecture for building games using the canvas api

- This is for personal use only, it must not be used for commercial gains.
- This is not just a roadfighter game, but an architecture for building reusable HTML 5 games.
- Please do not publish this, as the author is still working on the documentation for the architecture and plans to use this for his course.
- Happy Coding.
